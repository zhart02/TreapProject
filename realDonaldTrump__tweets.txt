b'Bad lawyer and fraudster Michael Cohen said under sworn testimony that he never asked for a Pardon. His lawyers totally contradicted him. He lied! Additionally, he directly asked me for a pardon. I said NO. He lied again! He also badly wanted to work at the White House. He lied!'

b'PRESIDENTIAL HARASSMENT!'
b'I cannot believe the level of dishonesty in the media. It is totally out of control, but we are winning!'
b'Thank you @foxandfriends. Great show!'
b'The Wall is being built and is well under construction. Big impact will be made. Many additional contracts are close to being signed. Far ahead of schedule despite all of the Democrat Obstruction and Fake News!'

b'We are on track to APPREHEND more than one million people coming across the Southern Border this year. Great job by Border Patrol (and others) who are working in a Broken System. Can be fixed by Congress so easily and quickly if only the Democrats would get on board!'
b'It was not a campaign contribution, and there were no violations of the campaign finance laws by me. Fake News!'
b'Democrats just blocked @FoxNews from holding a debate. Good, then I think I\xe2\x80\x99ll do the same thing with the Fake News Networks and the Radical Left Democrats in the General Election debates!'

b'Senate Republicans are not voting on constitutionality or precedent, they are voting on desperately needed Border Security &; the Wall. Our Country is being invaded with Drugs, Human Traffickers, &; Criminals of all shapes and sizes. That\xe2\x80\x99s what this vote is all about. STAY UNITED!'
b'Weirdo Tom Steyer doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have the \xe2\x80\x9cguts\xe2\x80\x9d or money to run for President. He\xe2\x80\x99s all talk! 
b'Hans Von Spakovsky, \xe2\x80\x9cI haven\xe2\x80\x99t seen any evidence of actual violations of the law, which is usually a basis before you start an investigation.

b'\xe2\x80\x9cThe American Media has changed forever. News organizations that seemed like a big deal are now extinct.  Those that remain have now degraded themselves beyond recognition, like the New Yorker - or they\xe2\x80\x99ve been purchased by Jeff Bezos to conduct unregistered lobbying for.........'
b'Presidential Harassment! 
b'\xe2\x80\x9cThere is no Collusion. All of these investigations are in search of a crime. Democrats have no evidence to impeach President Trump. Ridiculous!\xe2\x80\x9d @DevinNunes @FoxNews'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cNow that the Dems are going to try &; switch from Collusion to some other reason, it makes them continue to look like sore losers who didn\xe2\x80\x99t accept the WILL OF THE PEOPLE in the last election - they will do anything to get rid of the President.\xe2\x80\x9d @AriFleischer It will never work!'
b'The military drills, or war games as I call them, were never even discussed in my mtg w/ Kim Jong Un of NK\xe2\x80\x94FAKE NEWS! I made that decision long ago because it costs the U.S. far too much money to have those \xe2\x80\x9cgames\xe2\x80\x9d, especially since we are not reimbursed for the tremendous cost!'
b'FEMA has been told directly by me to give the A Plus treatment to the Great State of Alabama and the wonderful people who have been so devastated by the Tornadoes. @GovernorKayIvey, one of the best in our Country, has been so informed. She is working closely with FEMA (and me!).'
b'To the great people of Alabama and surrounding areas: Please be careful and safe. Tornadoes and storms were truly violent and more could be coming. To the families and friends of the victims, and to the injured, God bless you all!'
b'And also illegally leaking to Fake News CNN &; others? 
b'Schumer &; the Democrats are hurting our Country. Senate Republicans must take BOLD ACTION! 
b'For the Democrats to interview in open hearings a convicted liar &; fraudster, at the same time as the very important Nuclear Summit with North Korea, is perhaps a new low in American politics and may have contributed to the \xe2\x80\x9cwalk.\xe2\x80\x9d Never done when a president is overseas. Shame!'
b'....President. We are WINNING big, the envy of the WORLD, but just think what it could be?'
b'Presidential Harassment by \xe2\x80\x9ccrazed\xe2\x80\x9d Democrats at the highest level in the history of our Country. Likewise, the most vicious and corrupt Mainstream Media that any president has ever had to endure - Yet the most successful first two years for any'
b'The reason I do not want military drills with South Korea is to save hundreds of millions of dollars for the U.S. for which we are not reimbursed. That was my position long before I became President. Also, reducing tensions with North Korea at this time is a good thing!'
b'My wonderful daughter, Ivanka, will be interviewed tonight by Steve Hilton on \xe2\x80\x9cThe Next Revolution.\xe2\x80\x9d @FoxNews 9:00 P.M. She works so hard and has achieved so much for the U.S.A.(and gets so little credit!). Then watch Mark Levin at 10:00 P.M., a great show!'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cLook how they\xe2\x80\x99re acting now and how we act when we\xe2\x80\x99re in the majority. What the Democrats are doing is an abuse of power. They couldn\xe2\x80\x99t find anything...they took a Fake Dossier &; couldn\xe2\x80\x99t find any Collusion. Now they have a fake witness in Cohen.\xe2\x80\x9d Congressman Mark Green, (R-TN).'
b'After more than two years of Presidential Harassment, the only things that have been proven is that Democrats and other broke the law. The hostile Cohen testimony, given by a liar to reduce his prison time, proved no Collusion! His just written book manuscript showed what he.....'
b'...said was a total lie, but Fake Media won\xe2\x80\x99t show it. I am an innocent man being persecuted by some very bad, conflicted &; corrupt people in a Witch Hunt that is illegal &; should never have been allowed to start - And only because I won the Election! Despite this, great success!'

b'Virtually everything failed lawyer Michael Cohen said in his sworn testimony last week is totally contradicted in his just released manuscript for a book about me. It\xe2\x80\x99s a total new love letter to \xe2\x80\x9cTrump\xe2\x80\x9d and the pols must now use it rather than his lies for sentence reduction!'

b'I have asked China to immediately remove all Tariffs on our agricultural products (including beef, pork, etc.) based on the fact that we are moving along nicely with Trade discussions....'
b'....for Otto\xe2\x80\x99s mistreatment and death. Most important, Otto Warmbier will not have died in vain. Otto and his family have become a tremendous symbol of strong passion and strength, which will last for many years into the future. I love Otto and think of him often!'
b'I never like being misinterpreted, but especially when it comes to Otto Warmbier and his great family. Remember, I got Otto out along with three others. The previous Administration did nothing, and he was taken on their watch. Of course I hold North Korea responsible....'
b'Michael Cohen\xe2\x80\x99s book manuscript shows that he committed perjury on a scale not seen before. He must have forgotten about his book when he testified. What does Hillary Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s lawyer, Lanny Davis, say about this one. Is he being paid by Crooked Hillary. Using her lawyer?'
b'...and the fraudulent and dishonest statements he made on Wednesday. No way, it\xe2\x80\x99s time to stop this corrupt and illegally brought Witch Hunt. Time to start looking at the other side where real crimes were committed. Republicans have been abused long enough. Must end now!'
b'Oh\xe2\x80\x99 I see! Now that the 2 year Russian Collusion case has fallen apart, there was no Collusion except bye Crooked Hillary and the Democrats, they say, \xe2\x80\x9cgee, I have an idea, let\xe2\x80\x99s look at Trump\xe2\x80\x99s finances and every deal he has ever done. Let\xe2\x80\x99s follow discredited Michael Cohen.....'
b'Congress must demand the transcript of Michael Cohen\xe2\x80\x99s new book, given to publishers a short time ago. Your heads will spin when you see the lies, misrepresentations and contradictions  against his Thursday testimony. Like a different person! He is totally discredited!'
b'Wow, just revealed that Michael Cohen wrote a \xe2\x80\x9clove letter to Trump\xe2\x80\x9d manuscript for a new book that he was pushing. Written and submitted long after Charlottesville and Helsinki, his phony reasons for going rogue. Book is exact opposite of his fake testimony, which now is a lie!'
b'Great to be back from Vietnam, an amazing place. We had very substantive negotiations with Kim Jong Un - we know what they want and they know what we must have. Relationship very good, let\xe2\x80\x99s see what happens!'

b'Great meetings and dinner tonight in Vietnam with Kim Jong Un of North Korea. Very good dialogue. Resuming tomorrow!'
b'All false reporting (guessing) on my intentions with respect to North Korea. Kim Jong Un and I will try very hard to work something out on Denuclearization &; then making North Korea an Economic Powerhouse. I believe that China, Russia, Japan &; South Korea will be very helpful!'

b'Michael Cohen was one of many lawyers who represented me (unfortunately). He had other clients also. He was just disbarred by the State Supreme Court for lying &; fraud. He did bad things unrelated to Trump. He is lying in order to reduce his prison time. Using Crooked\xe2\x80\x99s lawyer!'
b'I have now spent more time in Vietnam than Da Nang Dick Blumenthal, the third rate Senator from Connecticut (how is Connecticut doing?). His war stories of his heroism in Vietnam were a total fraud - he was never even there. We talked about it today with Vietnamese leaders!'
b'The Democrats should stop talking about what I should do with North Korea and ask themselves instead why they didn\xe2\x80\x99t do \xe2\x80\x9cit\xe2\x80\x9d during eight years of the Obama Administration?'
b'Vietnam is thriving like few places on earth. North Korea would be the same, and very quickly, if it would denuclearize. The potential is AWESOME, a great opportunity, like almost none other in history, for my friend Kim Jong Un. We will know fairly soon - Very Interesting!'
b'Just arrived in Vietnam. Thank you to all of the people for the great reception in Hanoi. Tremendous crowds, and so much love!'

b'Heading over to Vietnam for my meeting with Kim Jong Un. Looking forward to a very productive Summit!'

b'\xe2\x80\x9cWhy on earth would any Republican vote not to put up a Wall or against Border Security. Please explain that to me?\xe2\x80\x9d @Varneyco'
b'I hope our great Republican Senators don\xe2\x80\x99t get led down the path of weak and ineffective Border Security. Without strong Borders, we don\xe2\x80\x99t have a Country - and the voters are on board with us. Be strong and smart, don\xe2\x80\x99t fall into the Democrats \xe2\x80\x9ctrap\xe2\x80\x9d of Open Borders and Crime!'
b'Former Senator Harry Reid (he got thrown out) is working hard to put a good spin on his failed career. He led through lies and deception, only to be replaced by another beauty, Cryin\xe2\x80\x99 Chuck Schumer. Some things just never change!'
b'Meeting for breakfast with our Nation\xe2\x80\x99s Governors - then off to Vietnam for a very important Summit with Kim Jong Un. With complete Denuclearization, North Korea will rapidly become an Economic Powerhouse. Without it, just more of the same. Chairman Kim will make a wise decision!'
b'Oil prices getting too high. OPEC, please relax and take it easy. World cannot take a price hike - fragile!'

b'We have a State of Emergency at our Southern Border. Border Patrol, our Military and local Law Enforcement are doing a great job, but without the Wall, which is now under major construction, you cannot have Border Security. Drugs, Gangs and Human Trafficking must be stopped!'

b'Chairman Kim realizes, perhaps better than anyone else, that without nuclear weapons, his country could fast become one of the great economic powers anywhere in the World. Because of its location and people (and him), it has more potential for rapid growth than any other nation!'
b'President Xi of China has been very helpful in his support of my meeting with Kim Jong Un. The last thing China wants are large scale nuclear weapons right next door. Sanctions placed on the border by China and Russia have been very helpful. Great relationship with Chairman Kim!'
b'Very productive talks yesterday with China on Trade. Will continue today! I will be leaving for Hanoi, Vietnam, early tomorrow for a Summit with Kim Jong Un of North Korea, where we both expect a continuation of the progress made at first Summit in Singapore. Denuclearization?'

Andrew McCabe (FBI) admitted to plotting a coup (government overthrow) when he was serving in the FBI, before he was fired for lying &; leaking.\xe2\x80\x9d @seanhannity @FoxNews  Treason!'
b'Today more than 50 countries around the world now recognize the rightful government of Venezuela. The Venezuelan people have spoken and the world has heard their voice. They are turning the page on Socialism and Dictatorship; and there will be NO GOING BACK! 
b'I ask every member of the Maduro regime: End this nightmare of poverty, hunger and death. LET YOUR PEOPLE GO. Set your country free! Now is the time for all Venezuelan Patriots to act together, as one united people. Nothing could be better for the future of Venezuela!'
b'The people of Venezuela are standing for FREEDOM and DEMOCRACY \xe2\x80\x93 and the United States of America is standing right by their side!'
b'We are here to proclaim that a new day is coming in Latin America. In Venezuela and across the Western Hemisphere, Socialism is DYING - and liberty, prosperity, and democracy are being REBORN...

b'Great analysis by @foxandfriends!'
b'....There is a lot of explaining to do to the millions of people who had just elected a president who they really like and who has done a great job for them with the Military, Vets, Economy and so much more. This was the illegal and treasonous \xe2\x80\x9cinsurance policy\xe2\x80\x9d in full action!'
b'Wow, so many lies by now disgraced acting FBI Director Andrew McCabe. He was fired for lying, and now his story gets even more deranged. He and Rod Rosenstein, who was hired by Jeff Sessions (another beauty), look like they were planning a very illegal act, and got caught.....'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cAfter two years and interviewing more than two hundred witnesses, the Senate Intelligence Committee has NOT discovered any direct evidence of a conspiracy between the Trump Campaign and Russia.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ken Dilanian @NBCNews'
b'William Barr is arriving at a Justice Department that desperately needs an infusion of credibility, writes @KimStrassel 
b'The Mueller investigation is totally conflicted, illegal and rigged! Should never have been allowed to begin, except for the Collusion and many crimes committed by the Democrats. Witch Hunt!'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cThese guys, the investigators, ought to be in jail. What they have done, working with the Obama intelligence agencies, is simply unprecedented. This is one of the greatest political hoaxes ever perpetrated on the people of this Country, and Mueller is a coverup.\xe2\x80\x9d  Rush Limbaugh'

b'52% Approval Rating, 93% in Republican Party ( a record )! Pretty amazing considering that 93% (also) of my press is REALLY BAD. The \xe2\x80\x9cpeople\xe2\x80\x9d are SMART!'
b'Democrats in the Senate are still slow walking hundreds of highly qualified people wanting to come into government. Never been such an abuse in our country\xe2\x80\x99s history. Mitch should not let Senate go home until all are approved. We need our Ambassadors and all others NOW!'
b'Important meetings and calls on China Trade Deal, and more, today with my staff. Big progress being made on soooo many different fronts! Our Country has such fantastic potential for future growth and greatness on an even higher level!'
b'....The U.S. does not want to watch as these ISIS fighters permeate Europe, which is where they are expected to go. We do so much, and spend so much - Time for others to step up and do the job that they are so capable of doing. We are pulling back after 100% Caliphate victory!'
b'The United States is asking Britain, France, Germany and other European allies to take back over 800 ISIS fighters that we captured in Syria and put them on trial. The Caliphate is ready to fall. The alternative is not a good one in that we will be forced to release them........'
b'Trade negotiators have just returned from China where the meetings on Trade were very productive. Now at meetings with me at Mar-a-Lago giving the details. In the meantime, Billions of Dollars are being paid to the United States by China in the form of Trade Tariffs!'

b'The Democrats are so self righteous and ANGRY! Loosen up and have some fun. The Country is doing well!'

b'No president ever worked harder than me (cleaning up the mess I inherited)!'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cFact checkers have become Fake News.\xe2\x80\x9d @JesseBWatters   So True!'
b'The U.S. will soon control 100% of ISIS territory in Syria. @CNN (do you believe this?).'
b'Well, it happened again. Amy Klobuchar announced that she is running for President, talking proudly of fighting global warming while standing in a virtual blizzard of snow, ice and freezing temperatures. Bad timing. By the end of her speech she looked like a Snowman(woman)!'
b'The Border Committee Democrats are behaving, all of a sudden, irrationally. Not only are they unwilling to give dollars for the obviously needed Wall (they overrode recommendations of Border Patrol experts), but they don\xe2\x80\x99t even want to take muderers into custody! What\xe2\x80\x99s going on?'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cPresident is on sound legal ground to declare a National Emergency. There have been 58 National Emergencies declared since the law was enacted in 1976, and 31 right now that are currently active, so this is hardly unprecedented.\xe2\x80\x9d Congressman @tommcclintock'
b'....The fact is, when I took over as President, our Country was a mess. Depleted Military, Endless Wars, a potential War with North Korea, V.A., High Taxes &; too many Regulations, Border, Immigration &; HealthCare problems, &; much more. I had no choice but to work very long hours!'
b'The media was able to get my work schedule, something very easy to do, but it should have been reported as a positive, not negative. When the term Executive Time is used, I am generally working, not relaxing. In fact, I probably work more hours than almost any past President.....'
b'It was a very bad week for the Democrats, with the GREAT economic numbers, The Virginia disaster and the State of the Union address. Now, with the terrible offers being made by them to the Border Committee, I actually believe they want a Shutdown. They want a new subject!'
b'I don\xe2\x80\x99t think the Dems on the Border Committee are being allowed by their leaders to make a deal. They are offering very little money for the desperately needed Border Wall &; now, out of the blue, want a cap on convicted violent felons to be held in detention!'
b'Gallup Poll: \xe2\x80\x9cOpen Borders will potentially attract 42 million Latin Americans.\xe2\x80\x9d This would be a disaster for the U.S. We need the Wall now!'

b'Senator Richard Burr, The Chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, just announced that after almost two years, more than two hundred interviews, and thousands of documents, they have found NO COLLUSION BETWEEN TRUMP AND RUSSIA! Is anybody really surprised by this?'
b'I think it is very important for the Democrats to press forward with their Green New Deal. It would be great for the so-called \xe2\x80\x9cCarbon Footprint\xe2\x80\x9d to permanently eliminate all Planes, Cars, Cows, Oil, Gas &; the Military - even if no other country would do the same. Brilliant!'
b'Today Elizabeth Warren, sometimes referred to by me as Pocahontas, joined the race for President. Will she run as our first Native American presidential candidate, or has she decided that after 32 years, this is not playing so well anymore? See you on the campaign TRAIL, Liz!'
b'The Democrats just don\xe2\x80\x99t seem to want Border Security. They are fighting Border Agents recommendations. If you believe news reports, they are not offering much for the Wall. They look to be making this a campaign issue. The Wall will get built one way or the other!'
b'We have a great economy DESPITE the Obama Administration and all of its job killing Regulations and Roadblocks. If that thinking prevailed in the 2016 Election, the U.S. would be in a Depression right now! We were heading down, and don\xe2\x80\x99t let the Democrats sound bites fool you!'
b'The Democrats in Congress yesterday were vicious and totally showed their cards for everyone to see. When the Republicans had the Majority they never acted with such hatred and scorn! The Dems are trying to win an election in 2020 that they know they cannot legitimately win!'
b'It was great meeting some of our outstanding young military personnel who were wounded in both Syria and Afghanistan. Their wounds are deep but their spirit is sooo high. They will recoverer &; be back very soon. America loves them. Walter Reed Hospital is AMAZING - Thank you all!'
b'North Korea, under the leadership of Kim Jong Un, will become a great Economic Powerhouse. He may surprise some but he won\xe2\x80\x99t surprise me, because I have gotten to know him &; fully understand how capable he is. North Korea will become a different kind of Rocket - an Economic one!'

b'The mainstream media has refused to cover the fact that the head of the VERY important Senate Intelligence Committee, after two years of intensive study and access to Intelligence that only they could get, just stated that they have found NO COLLUSION between \xe2\x80\x9cTrump\xe2\x80\x9d &; Russia....'

b'Highly respected Senator Richard Burr, Chairman of Senate Intelligence, said today that, after an almost two year investigation, he saw no evidence of Russia collusion. \xe2\x80\x9cWe don\xe2\x80\x99t have anything that would suggest there was collusion by the Trump campaign and Russia.\xe2\x80\x9d  Thank you!'

b'I inherited a total mess in Syria and Afghanistan, the \xe2\x80\x9cEndless Wars\xe2\x80\x9d of unlimited spending and death.

b'Wish I could share with everyone the beauty and majesty of being in the White House and looking outside at the snow filled lawns and Rose Garden. Really is something - SPECIAL COUNTRY, SPECIAL PLACE!'
b'Thousands of illegal aliens who have committed sexual crimes against children are right now in Texas prisons. Most came through our Southern Border. We can end this easily - We need a Steel Barrier or Wall. Walls Work! John Jones, Texas Department of Public Safety.  @FoxNews'
b'The damage done to our Country from a badly broken Border - Drugs, Crime and so much that is bad - is far greater than a Shutdown, which the Dems can easily fix as soon as they come back to Washington!'
b'I\xe2\x80\x99m in the White House, waiting. The Democrats are everywhere but Washington as people await their pay. They are having fun and not even talking!'
b'The building of the Wall on the Southern Border will bring down the crime rate throughout the entire Country!'
b'Democrats are saying that DACA is not worth it and don\xe2\x80\x99t want to include in talks. Many Hispanics will be coming over to the Republican side, watch!'
b'I will be interviewed by Jeanine Pirro at 9:00 P.M. on @FoxNews. Watch @JesseBWatters before and @greggutfeld after. All terrific people. I am in the White House waiting for Cryin\xe2\x80\x99 Chuck and Nancy to call so we can start helping our Country both at the Border and from within!'
b'
b'We have a massive Humanitarian Crisis at our Southern Border. We will be out for a long time unless the Democrats come back from their \xe2\x80\x9cvacations\xe2\x80\x9d and get back to work. I am in the White House ready to sign!'
b'....I do have a plan on the Shutdown. But to understand that plan you would have to understand the fact that I won the election, and I promised safety and security for the American people. Part of that promise was a Wall at the Southern Border. Elections have consequences!'
b'I just watched a Fake reporter from the Amazon Washington Post say the White House is \xe2\x80\x9cchaotic, there does not seem to be a strategy for this Shutdown. There is no plan.\xe2\x80\x9d The Fakes always like talking Chaos, there is NONE. In fact, there\xe2\x80\x99s almost nobody in the W.H. but me, and...'
b'Democrats could solve the Shutdown in 15 minutes! Call your Dem Senator or Congresswoman/man. Tell them to get it done! Humanitarian Crisis.'
b'23% of Federal inmates are illegal immigrants. Border arrests are up 240%. In the Great State of Texas, between 2011 &; 2018, there were a total of 292,000 crimes by illegal aliens, 539 murders, 32,000 assaults, 3,426 sexual assaults and 3000 weapons charges. Democrats come back!'
b'Democrats should come back to Washington and work to end the Shutdown, while at the same time ending the horrible humanitarian crisis at our Southern Border. I am in the White House waiting for you!'
b'Lyin\xe2\x80\x99 James Comey, Andrew McCabe, Peter S and his lover, agent Lisa Page, &; more, all disgraced and/or fired and caught in the act. These are just some of the losers that tried to do a number on your President. Part of the Witch Hunt. Remember the \xe2\x80\x9cinsurance policy?\xe2\x80\x9d This is it!'
b'I have been FAR tougher on Russia than Obama, Bush or Clinton. Maybe tougher than any other President. At the same time, &; as I have often said, getting along with Russia is a good thing, not a bad thing. I fully expect that someday we will have good relations with Russia again!'
b'.....who is being totally protected by his best friend, Bob Mueller, &; the 13 Angry Democrats - leaking machines who have NO interest in going after the Real Collusion (and much more) by Crooked Hillary Clinton, her Campaign, and the Democratic National Committee. Just Watch!'
b'....the FBI was in complete turmoil (see N.Y. Post) because of Comey\xe2\x80\x99s poor leadership and the way he handled the Clinton mess (not to mention his usurpation of powers from the Justice Department). My firing of James Comey was a great day for America. He was a Crooked Cop......'
b'...Funny thing about James Comey. Everybody wanted him fired, Republican and Democrat alike. After the rigged &; botched Crooked Hillary investigation, where she was interviewed on July 4th Weekend, not recorded or sworn in, and where she said she didn\xe2\x80\x99t know anything (a lie),....'
b'Wow, just learned in the Failing New York Times that the corrupt former leaders of the FBI, almost all fired or forced to leave the agency for some very bad reasons, opened up an investigation on me, for no reason &; with no proof, after I fired Lyin\xe2\x80\x99 James Comey, a total sleaze!'
b'.@CNN called a San Diego news station (@KUSINews) for negative reports on the Wall. When the station said that Walls work, CNN no longer had interest. #FakeNews 
b'Drug prices declined in 2018, the first time in nearly half a century. During the first 19 months of my Administration, Americans saved $26 Billion on prescription drugs. Our policies to get cheaper generic drugs to market are working!'
b'I look forward to hosting, right out of the great State of South Carolina, the 2019 NCAA Football Champion Clemson Tigers at the White House on Monday, January 14th. What a game, what a coach, what a team!'
b'The Fake News Media keeps saying we haven\xe2\x80\x99t built any NEW WALL. Below is a section just completed on the Border. Anti-climbing feature included. Very high, strong and beautiful! Also, many miles already renovated and in service! 
b'...The Steel Barrier, or Wall, should have been built by previous administrations long ago. They never got it done - I will. Without it, our Country cannot be safe. Criminals, Gangs, Human Traffickers, Drugs &; so much other big trouble can easily pour in. It can be stopped cold!'
b'Humanitarian Crisis at our Southern Border. I just got back and it is a far worse situation than almost anyone would understand, an invasion! I have been there numerous times - The Democrats, Cryin\xe2\x80\x99 Chuck and Nancy don\xe2\x80\x99t know how bad and dangerous it is for our ENTIRE COUNTRY....'
b'H1-B holders in the United States can rest assured that changes are soon coming which will bring both simplicity and certainty to your stay, including a potential path to citizenship. We want to encourage talented and highly skilled people to pursue career options in the U.S.'
b'I often said during rallies, with little variation, that \xe2\x80\x9cMexico will pay for the Wall.\xe2\x80\x9d We have just signed a great new Trade Deal with Mexico. It is Billions of Dollars a year better than the very bad NAFTA deal which it replaces. The difference pays for Wall many times over!'
b'When I took the Oath of Office.... 
b'We lose 300 Americans a week, 90% of which comes through the Southern Border. These numbers will be DRASTICALLY REDUCED if we have a Wall!'
b'Will be interviewed at the Border by @seanhannity on @FoxNews tonight at 9:00. Enjoy!'
b'Dear Diary... 
b'From the Southern Border.... 
b'Because of the Democrats intransigence on Border Security and the great importance of Safety for our Nation, I am respectfully cancelling my very important trip to Davos, Switzerland for the World Economic Forum. My warmest regards and apologies to the @WEF!'
b'President Obama, thank you for your great support \xe2\x80\x93 I have been saying this all along! 
b'MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!'
b'Getting ready to leave for the Great State of Texas! #MAGA'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cGreat support for Border Security and the Wall.\xe2\x80\x9d @foxandfriends  Even greater than anyone would know! \xe2\x80\x9cPresidents supporters do not want him to cave.\xe2\x80\x9d @SteveDoocy I won\xe2\x80\x99t!'
b'There is GREAT unity with the Republicans in the House and Senate, despite the Fake News Media working in overdrive to make the story look otherwise. The Opposition Party &; the Dems know we must have Strong Border Security, but don\xe2\x80\x99t want to give \xe2\x80\x9cTrump\xe2\x80\x9d another one of many wins!'
b'Cryin Chuck told his favorite lie when he used his standard sound bite that I \xe2\x80\x9cslammed the table &; walked out of the room. He had a temper tantrum.\xe2\x80\x9d Because I knew he would say that, and after Nancy said no to proper Border Security, I politely said bye-bye and left, no slamming!'
b'Gave an OFF THE RECORD luncheon, somewhat of a White House tradition or custom, to network anchors yesterday - and they quickly leaked the contents of the meeting. Who would believe how bad it has gotten with the mainstream media, which has gone totally bonkers!'
b'The Mainstream Media has NEVER been more dishonest than it is now. NBC and MSNBC are going Crazy. They report stories, purposely, the exact opposite of the facts. They are truly the Opposition Party working with the Dems. May even be worse than Fake News CNN, if that is possible!'
b'Just left a meeting with Chuck and Nancy, a total waste of time. I asked what is going to happen in 30 days if I quickly open things up, are you going to approve Border Security which includes a Wall or Steel Barrier? Nancy said, NO. I said bye-bye, nothing else works!'
b"Thank you to all of America's brave police, deputies, sheriffs, and federal law enforcement on National Law Enforcement Appreciation Day! We love you and will always support you. 
b'Billions of dollars are sent to the State of California for Forest fires that, with proper Forest Management, would never happen. Unless they get their act together, which is unlikely, I have ordered FEMA to send no more money. It is a disgraceful situation in lives &; money!'
b'Our Country is doing so well in so many ways. Great jobs numbers, with a record setting December. We are rebuilding our military. Vets finally have Choice &; Accountability. Economy &; GDP are strong. Tax &; Reg cuts historic. Trade deals great. But we MUST fix our Southern Border!'
b'Thank you for soooo many nice comments regarding my Oval Office speech. A very interesting experience!'
b'
b'Congratulations to a truly great football team, the Clemson Tigers, on an incredible win last night against a powerful Alabama team. A big win also for the Great State of South Carolina. Look forward to seeing the team, and their brilliant coach, for the second time at the W.H.'
b'Talks with China are going very well!'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cThe President is the biggest and best supporter of the Steel Industry in many years. We are now doing really well. The Tariffs let us compete. Was unfair that the Steel Industry lost its jobs to unfair trade laws. Very positive outcome.\xe2\x80\x9d Mark Glyptis, United Steelworkers'
b'Economic numbers looking REALLY good. Can you imagine if I had long term ZERO interest rates to play with like the past administration, rather than the rapidly raised normalized rates we have today. That would have been SO EASY! Still, markets up BIG since 2016 Election!'
b'Endless Wars, especially those which are fought out of judgement mistakes that were made many years ago, &; those where we are getting little financial or military help from the rich countries that so greatly benefit from what we are doing, will eventually come to a glorious end!'
b'I am pleased to inform you that I will Address the Nation on the Humanitarian and National Security crisis on our Southern Border. Tuesday night at 9:00 P.M. Eastern.'
b'The Failing New York Times has knowingly written a very inaccurate story on my intentions on Syria. No different from my original statements, we will be leaving at a proper pace while at the same time continuing to fight ISIS and doing all else that is prudent and necessary!.....'
b'Congressman Adam Smith, the new Chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, just stated, \xe2\x80\x9cYes, there is a provision in law that says a president can declare an emergency. It\xe2\x80\x99s been done a number of times.\xe2\x80\x9d No doubt, but let\xe2\x80\x99s get our deal done in Congress!'
b'....The Fake News Media in our Country is the real Opposition Party. It is truly the Enemy of the People! We must bring honesty back to journalism and reporting!'
b'...The Fake News will knowingly lie and demean in order make the tremendous success of the Trump Administration, and me, look as bad as possible. They use non-existent sources &; write stories that are total fiction. Our Country is doing so well, yet this is a sad day in America!'
b'With all of the success that our Country is having, including the just released jobs numbers which are off the charts, the Fake News &; totally dishonest Media concerning me and my presidency has never been worse. Many have become crazed lunatics who have given up on the TRUTH!...'
b'V.P. Mike Pence and group had a productive meeting with the Schumer/Pelosi representatives today. Many details of Border Security were discussed. We are now planning a Steel Barrier rather than concrete. It is both stronger &; less obtrusive. Good solution, and made in the U.S.A.'
b'Our GREAT MILITARY has delivered justice for the heroes lost and wounded in the cowardly attack on the USS Cole. We have just killed the leader of that attack, Jamal al-Badawi. Our work against al Qaeda continues. We will never stop in our fight against Radical Islamic Terrorism!'
b'Excited to see our friends in Egypt opening the biggest Cathedral in the Middle East. President El-Sisi is moving his country to a more inclusive future!'
b'....The only reason they do not want to build a Wall is that Walls Work! 99% of our illegal Border crossings will end, crime in our Country will go way down and we will save billions of dollars a year! A properly planned and constructed Wall will pay for itself many times a year!'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cWe simply cannot allow people to pour into the United States undetected, undocumented, unchecked...\xe2\x80\x9d Barrack Obama, 2005. I voted, when I was a Senator, to build a barrier to try to prevent illegal immigrants from coming in...\xe2\x80\x9d Hillary Clinton, 2015.'
b'
b'Will be going to Camp David tomorrow morning for meetings on Border Security and many other topics with @WhiteHouse senior staff.'
b'AP-NORC POLL: \xe2\x80\x9cImmigration among the top concerns in 2019.\xe2\x80\x9d People want to stop drugs and criminals at the Border. Want Border Security! Tell the Dems to do the inevitable now, rather than later. The wait is costly and dangerous!'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cThe number of employed Americans has now set a 14th record under President Trump. Over the year, average hourly earnings have increased by 84 cents, or 3.2%. Participation Rate hits Trump-Era High.\xe2\x80\x9d CNS NEWS.  And we will do even better with new trade deals and all else!'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cJobs up big, plus 312,000. Record number working. Manufacturing best in 20 years (Previous administration said this could not happen). Hispanic unemployment lowest ever. Dow plus 747 (for day).\xe2\x80\x9d @DRUDGE_REPORT'
b'V.P. Mike Pence and team just left the White House. Briefed me on their meeting with the Schumer/Pelosi representatives. Not much headway made today. Second meeting set for tomorrow. After so many decades, must finally and permanently fix the problems on the Southern Border!'
b'Drug makers and companies are not living up to their commitments on pricing. Not being fair to the consumer, or to our Country!'
b"\xe2\x80\x9cFormer @NYTimes editor Jill Abramson rips paper's \xe2\x80\x98unmistakably anti-Trump\xe2\x80\x99 bias.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nMs. Abramson is 100% correct. Horrible and totally dishonest reporting on almost everything they write. Hence the term Fake News, Enemy of the People, and Opposition Party!"
b'Great Tweet today by Tyler Q. Houlton @SpoxDHS on the #FakeNews being put out by @CNN, a proud member of the Opposition Party. @TSA is doing a great job!'
b'The Democrats want Billions of Dollars for Foreign Aid, but they don\xe2\x80\x99t want to spend a small fraction of that number on properly securing our Border. Figure that one out!'
b'We are working hard at the Border, but we need a WALL!  In 2018, 1.7 million pounds of narcotics seized, 17,000 adults arrested with criminal records, and 6000 gang members, including MS-13, apprehended. A big Human Trafficking problem.'
b'I don\xe2\x80\x99t care that most of the workers not getting paid are Democrats, I want to stop the Shutdown as soon as we are in agreement on Strong Border Security! I am in the White House ready to go, where are the Dems?'
b'Many people currently a part of my opposition, including President Obama &; the Dems, have had campaign violations, in some cases for very large sums of money. These are civil cases. They paid a fine &; settled. While no big deal, I did not commit a campaign violation!'
b'The Democrats could solve the Shutdown problem in a very short period of time. All they have to do is approve REAL Border Security (including a Wall), something which everyone, other than drug dealers, human traffickers and criminals, want very badly! This would be so easy to do!'
b'Great support coming from all sides for Border Security (including Wall) on our very dangerous Southern Border. Teams negotiating this weekend! Washington Post and NBC reporting of events, including Fake sources, has been very inaccurate (to put it mildly)!'
b'Thank you to Kanye West for your nice words. Criminal Justice Reform is now law - passed in a very bipartisan way!'
b'Great new book by Dr. Robert Jeffress, \xe2\x80\x9cChoosing the Extraordinary Life.\xe2\x80\x9d Get it and enjoy!  @LouDobbs'
b'The story in the New York Times regarding Jim Webb being considered as the next Secretary of Defense is FAKE NEWS. I\xe2\x80\x99m sure he is a fine man, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t know Jim, and never met him. Patrick Shanahan, who is Acting Secretary of Defense, is doing a great job!'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cJob growth surges by 312,000 in December\xe2\x80\x9d 
b'GREAT JOBS NUMBERS JUST ANNOUNCED!'
b'How do you impeach a president who has won perhaps the greatest election of all time, done nothing wrong (no Collusion with Russia, it was the Dems that Colluded), had the most successful first two years of any president, and is the most popular Republican in party history 93%?'
b'As I have stated many times, if the Democrats take over the House or Senate, there will be disruption to the Financial Markets. We won the Senate, they won the House. Things will settle down. They only want to impeach me because they know they can\xe2\x80\x99t win in 2020, too much success!'
b'....President Trump deserves a lot of credit, but again, you have the anti-Trump people who are not going to give him a lot of credit.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Michael Pillsbury interviewed by @cvpayne: \xe2\x80\x9cThey have the motive of making the President look bad \xe2\x80\x93 instead of President Trump being portrayed as a HERO. The first President to take China on, it\xe2\x80\x99s 20 years overdue....'

b'The RNC has a great Chairwoman in Ronna McDaniel and the @GOP has never been stronger. We achieved historic wins with her help last year! #MAGA\xf0\x9f\x87\xba\xf0\x9f\x87\xb8'
b'
b'The United States Treasury has taken in MANY billions of dollars from the Tariffs we are charging China and other countries that have not treated us fairly. In the meantime we are doing well in various Trade Negotiations currently going on. At some point this had to be done!'
b'The Shutdown is only because of the 2020 Presidential Election. The Democrats know they can\xe2\x80\x99t win based on all of the achievements of \xe2\x80\x9cTrump,\xe2\x80\x9d so they are going all out on the desperately needed Wall and Border Security - and Presidential Harassment. For them, strictly politics!'

b'Sadly, there can be no REAL Border Security without the Wall!'
b'...I remain ready and willing to work with Democrats to pass a bill that secures our borders, supports the agents and officers on the ground, and keeps America Safe. Let\xe2\x80\x99s get it done!'
b'Important meeting today on Border Security with Republican and Democrat Leaders in Congress. Both parties must work together to pass a Funding Bill that protects this Nation and its people \xe2\x80\x93 this is the first and most important duty of government...'
b'Mexico is paying for the Wall through the new USMCA Trade Deal. Much of the Wall has already been fully renovated or built. We have done a lot of work. $5.6 Billion Dollars that House has approved is very little in comparison to the benefits of National Security. Quick payback!'
b'Here we go with Mitt Romney, but so fast! Question will be, is he a Flake?  I hope not. Would much prefer that Mitt focus on Border Security and so many other things where he can be helpful. I won big, and he didn\xe2\x80\x99t. He should be happy for all Republicans. Be a TEAM player &; WIN!'
b'For FAR TOO LONG Senate Democrats have been Obstructing more than 350 Nominations. These great Americans left their jobs to serve our Country, but can\xe2\x80\x99t because Dems are blocking them, some for two years-historic record. Passed committees, but Schumer putting them on hold. Bad!'
b'Do you think it\xe2\x80\x99s just luck that gas prices are so low, and falling? Low gas prices are like another Tax Cut!'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cKim Jong Un says North Korea will not make or test nuclear weapons, or give them to others - &; he is ready to meet President Trump anytime.\xe2\x80\x9d PBS News Hour. I also look forward to meeting with Chairman Kim who realizes so well that North Korea possesses great economic potential!'
b'Washington Examiner - \xe2\x80\x9cMAGA list: 205 \xe2\x80\x98historic results\xe2\x80\x99 help Trump make case for 2020 re-election.\xe2\x80\x9d  True!'
b'Gas prices are low and expected to go down this year. This would be good!'
b'Border Security and the Wall \xe2\x80\x9cthing\xe2\x80\x9d and Shutdown is not where Nancy Pelosi wanted to start her tenure as Speaker! Let\xe2\x80\x99s make a deal?'
b'Congratulations to President \n@JairBolsonaro who just made a great inauguration speech - the U.S.A. is with you!'
b'One thing has now been proven. The Democrats do not care about Open Borders and all of the crime and drugs that Open Borders bring!'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cGeneral\xe2\x80\x9d McChrystal got fired like a dog by Obama. Last assignment a total bust. Known for big, dumb mouth. Hillary lover! 
b'The Democrats, much as I suspected, have allocated no money for a new Wall. So imaginative! The problem is, without a Wall there can be no real Border Security - and our Country must finally have a Strong and Secure Southern Border!'
b'Happy New Year!'
b'HAPPY NEW YEAR TO EVERYONE, INCLUDING THE HATERS AND THE FAKE NEWS MEDIA! 2019 WILL BE A FANTASTIC YEAR FOR THOSE NOT SUFFERING FROM TRUMP DERANGEMENT SYNDROME. JUST CALM DOWN AND ENJOY THE RIDE, GREAT THINGS ARE HAPPENING FOR OUR COUNTRY!'
b'Dr. Sebastian Gorka, a very good and talented guy, has a great new book just out, \xe2\x80\x9cWhy We Fight.\xe2\x80\x9d Lots of insight - Enjoy!'
b'...Remember this. Throughout the ages some things NEVER get better and NEVER change. You have Walls and you have Wheels. It was ALWAYS that way and it will ALWAYS be that way! Please explain to the Democrats that there can NEVER be a replacement for a good old fashioned WALL!'
b'The Democrats will probably submit a Bill, being cute as always, which gives everything away but gives NOTHING to Border Security, namely the Wall. You see, without the Wall there can be no Border Security - the Tech \xe2\x80\x9cstuff\xe2\x80\x9d is just, by comparison, meaningless bells &; whistles...'
b'MEXICO IS PAYING FOR THE WALL through the many billions of dollars a year that the U.S.A. is saving through the new Trade Deal, the USMCA, that will replace the horrendous NAFTA Trade Deal, which has so badly hurt our Country. Mexico &; Canada will also thrive - good for all!'
b'HAPPY NEW YEAR! 
b'....Senator Schumer, more than a year longer than any other Administration in history. These are people who have been approved by committees and all others, yet Schumer continues to hold them back from serving their Country! Very Unfair!'
b'Heads of countries are calling wanting to know why Senator Schumer is not approving their otherwise approved Ambassadors!? Likewise in Government lawyers and others are being delayed at a record pace! 360 great and hardworking people are waiting for approval from....'
b'It\xe2\x80\x99s incredible how Democrats can all use their ridiculous sound bite and say that a Wall doesn\xe2\x80\x99t work. It does, and properly built, almost 100%! They say it\xe2\x80\x99s old technology - but so is the wheel. They now say it is immoral- but it is far more immoral for people to be dying!'
b'I\xe2\x80\x99m in the Oval Office. Democrats, come back from vacation now and give us the votes necessary for Border Security, including the Wall. You voted yes in 2006 and 2013. One more yes, but with me in office, I\xe2\x80\x99ll get it built, and Fast!'
b'I am the only person in America who could say that, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m bringing our great troops back home, with victory,\xe2\x80\x9d and get BAD press. It is Fake News and Pundits who have FAILED for years that are doing the complaining. If I stayed in Endless Wars forever, they would still be unhappy!'
b'I campaigned on Border Security, which you cannot have without a strong and powerful Wall. Our Southern Border has long been an \xe2\x80\x9cOpen Wound,\xe2\x80\x9d where drugs, criminals (including human traffickers) and illegals would pour into our Country. Dems should get back here an fix now!'
b'.....Except the results are FAR BETTER than I ever said they were going to be! I campaigned against the NEVER ENDING WARS, remember!'
b'...I campaigned on getting out of Syria and other places. Now when I start getting out the Fake News Media, or some failed Generals who were unable to do the job before I arrived, like to complain about me &; my tactics, which are working. Just doing what I said I was going to do!'
b'If anybody but Donald Trump did what I did in Syria, which was an ISIS loaded mess when I became President, they would be a national hero. ISIS is mostly gone, we\xe2\x80\x99re slowly sending our troops back home to be with their families, while at the same time fighting ISIS remnants......'
b'An all concrete Wall was NEVER ABANDONED, as has been reported by the media. Some areas will be all concrete but the experts at Border Patrol prefer a Wall that is see through (thereby making it possible to see what is happening on both sides). Makes sense to me!'
b'President and Mrs. Obama built/has a ten foot Wall around their D.C. mansion/compound. I agree, totally necessary for their safety and security. The U.S. needs the same thing, slightly larger version!'
b'Great work by my Administration over the holidays to save Coast Guard pay during this #SchumerShutdown. No thanks to the Democrats who left town and are not concerned about the safety and security of Americans!'
b'Veterans on President Trump\xe2\x80\x99s handling of Border Security - 62% Approval Rating. On being a strong leader - 59%.  AP Poll. Thank you!'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cIt turns out to be true now, that the Department of Justice and the FBI, under President Obama, rigged the investigation for Hillary and really turned the screws on Trump, and now it looks like in a corrupt &; illegal way. The facts are out now. Whole Hoax exposed. @JesseBWatters'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cAbsolutely nothing\xe2\x80\x9d (on Russian Collusion). Kimberley Strassel, The Wall Street Journal. The Russian Collusion fabrication is the greatest Hoax in the history of American politics. The only Russian Collusion was with Hillary and the Democrats!'
b'2018 is being called \xe2\x80\x9cTHE YEAR OF THE WORKER\xe2\x80\x9d by Steve Moore, co-author of \xe2\x80\x9cTrumponomics.\xe2\x80\x9d It was indeed a great year for the American Worker with the \xe2\x80\x9cbest job market in 50 years, and the lowest unemployment rate ever for blacks and Hispanics and all workers. Big wage gains.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'For those that naively ask why didn\xe2\x80\x99t the Republicans get approval to build the Wall over the last year, it is because IN THE SENATE WE NEED 10 DEMOCRAT VOTES, and they will gives us \xe2\x80\x9cNONE\xe2\x80\x9d for Border Security! Now we have to do it the hard way, with a Shutdown. Too bad! @FoxNews'
b'...children in question were very sick before they were given over to Border Patrol. The father of the young girl said it was not their fault, he hadn\xe2\x80\x99t given her water in days. Border Patrol needs the Wall and it will all end. They are working so hard &; getting so little credit!'
b'Any deaths of children or others at the Border are strictly the fault of the Democrats and their pathetic immigration policies that allow people to make the long trek thinking they can enter our country illegally. They can\xe2\x80\x99t. If we had a Wall, they wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t even try! The two.....'
b'Just had a long and very good call with President Xi of China. Deal is moving along very well. If made, it will be very comprehensive, covering all subjects, areas and points of dispute. Big progress being made!'
b'I am in the White House waiting for the Democrats to come on over and make a deal on Border Security. From what I hear, they are spending so much time on Presidential Harassment that they have little time left for things like stopping crime and our military!'
b'The Mueller Angry Democrats recently deleted approximately 19,000 Text messages between FBI Agent Lisa Page and her lover, Agent Peter S. These Texts were asked for and INVALUABLE to the truth of the Witch Hunt Hoax. This is a total Obstruction of Justice. All Texts Demanded!'
b'Thank you to Sean Parnell for the nice comments on @foxandfriends about the troops wonderful reaction to Melania and I in Iraq and Germany. Great things are happening!'
b'.....Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador are doing nothing for the United States but taking our money. Word is that a new Caravan is forming in Honduras and they are doing nothing about it. We will be cutting off all aid to these 3 countries - taking advantage of U.S. for years!'
b'.....close the Southern Border. Bring our car industry back into the United States where it belongs. Go back to pre-NAFTA, before so many of our companies and jobs were so foolishly sent to Mexico. Either we build (finish) the Wall or we close the Border......'
b'....The United States looses soooo much money on Trade with Mexico under NAFTA, over 75 Billion Dollars a year (not including Drug Money which would be many times that amount), that I would consider closing the Southern Border a \xe2\x80\x9cprofit making operation.\xe2\x80\x9d We build a Wall or.....'
b'We will be forced to close the Southern Border entirely if the Obstructionist Democrats do not give us the money to finish the Wall &; also change the ridiculous immigration laws that our Country is saddled with. Hard to believe there was a Congress &; President who would approve!'
b'CNN &; others within the Fake News Universe were going wild about my signing MAGA hats for our military in Iraq and Germany. If these brave young people ask me to sign their hat, I will sign. Can you imagine my saying NO? We brought or gave NO hats as the Fake News first reported!'
b'This isn\xe2\x80\x99t about the Wall, everybody knows that a Wall will work perfectly (In Israel the Wall works 99.9%). This is only about the Dems not letting Donald Trump &; the Republicans have a win. They may have the 10 Senate votes, but we have the issue, Border Security. 2020!'
b'Brad Blakeman: \xe2\x80\x9cThe American people understand that we have been played by foreign actors who would rather have us fight their battles for them. The President says look, this is your neighborhood, you\xe2\x80\x99ve got to stand up to protect yourselves. Don\xe2\x80\x99t always look to America.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'I totally agree! 
b'There is right now a full scale manhunt going on in California for an illegal immigrant accused of shooting and killing a police officer during a traffic stop. Time to get tough on Border Security. Build the Wall!'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cBorder Patrol Agents want the Wall.\xe2\x80\x9d Democrat\xe2\x80\x99s say they don\xe2\x80\x99t want the Wall (even though they know it is really needed), and they don\xe2\x80\x99t want ICE. They don\xe2\x80\x99t have much to campaign on, do they? An Open Southern Border and the large scale crime that comes with such stupidity!'
b'The reason the DACA for Wall deal didn\xe2\x80\x99t get done was that a ridiculous court decision from the 9th Circuit allowed DACA to remain, thereby setting up a Supreme Court case. After ruling, Dems dropped deal - and that\xe2\x80\x99s where we are today, Democrat obstruction of the needed Wall.'
b'The Democrats OBSTRUCTION of the desperately needed Wall, where they almost all recently agreed it should be built, is exceeded only by their OBSTRUCTION of 350 great people wanting &; expecting to come into Government after being delayed for more than two years, a U.S. record!'
b'Have the Democrats finally realized that we desperately need Border Security and a Wall on the Southern Border. Need to stop Drugs, Human Trafficking,Gang Members &; Criminals from coming into our Country. Do the Dems realize that most of the people not getting paid are Democrats?'
b'Just returned from visiting our troops in Iraq and Germany. One thing is certain, we have incredible people representing our Country - people that know how to win!'
b'.@FLOTUS Melania and I were honored to visit our incredible troops at Al Asad Air Base in Iraq. GOD BLESS THE U.S.A.! 
b'I hope everyone, even the Fake News Media, is having a great Christmas! Our Country is doing very well. We are securing our Borders, making great new Trade Deals, and bringing our Troops Back Home. We are finally putting America First. MERRY CHRISTMAS!  #MAGA'
b'Merry Christmas!'
b'I am in the Oval Office &; just gave out a 115 mile long contract for another large section of the Wall in Texas. We are already building and renovating many miles of Wall, some complete. Democrats must end Shutdown and finish funding. Billions of Dollars, &; lives, will be saved!'
b'Christmas Eve briefing with my team working on North Korea \xe2\x80\x93 Progress being made. Looking forward to my next summit with Chairman Kim! 
b'I am all alone (poor me) in the White House waiting for the Democrats to come back and make a deal on desperately needed Border Security. At some point the Democrats not wanting to make a deal will cost our Country more money than the Border Wall we are all talking about. Crazy!'
b'Saudi Arabia has now agreed to spend the necessary money needed to help rebuild Syria, instead of the United States. See? Isn\xe2\x80\x99t it nice when immensely wealthy countries help rebuild their neighbors rather than a Great Country, the U.S., that is 5000 miles away. Thanks to Saudi A!'
b'The Wall is different than the 25 Billion Dollars in Border Security. The complete Wall will be built with the Shutdown money plus funds already in hand. The reporting has been inaccurate on the point. The problem is, without the Wall, much of the rest of Dollars are wasted!'
b'I never \xe2\x80\x9clashed out\xe2\x80\x9d at the Acting Attorney General of the U.S., a man for whom I have great respect. This is a made up story, one of many, by the Fake News Media!'
b'The only problem our economy has is the Fed. They don\xe2\x80\x99t have a feel for the Market, they don\xe2\x80\x99t understand necessary Trade Wars or Strong Dollars or even Democrat Shutdowns over Borders. The Fed is like a powerful golfer who can\xe2\x80\x99t score because he has no touch - he can\xe2\x80\x99t putt!'
b'AMERICA IS RESPECTED AGAIN!'
b'For all of the sympathizers out there of Brett McGurk remember, he was the Obama appointee who was responsible for loading up airplanes with 1.8 Billion Dollars in CASH &;  sending it to Iran as part of the horrific Iran Nuclear Deal (now terminated) approved by Little Bob Corker.'
b'....We are substantially subsidizing the Militaries of many VERY rich countries all over the world, while at the same time these countries take total advantage of the U.S., and our TAXPAYERS, on Trade. General Mattis did not see this as a problem. I DO, and it is being fixed!'
b'To those few Senators who think I don\xe2\x80\x99t like or appreciate being allied with other countries, they are wrong, I DO. What I don\xe2\x80\x99t like, however, is when many of these same countries take advantage of their friendship with the United States, both in Military Protection and Trade...'
b'Virtually every Democrat we are dealing with today strongly supported a Border Wall or Fence. It was only when I made it an important part of my campaign, because people and drugs were pouring into our Country unchecked, that they turned against it. Desperately needed!'
b'President @RT_Erdogan of Turkey has very strongly informed me that he will eradicate whatever is left of ISIS in Syria....and he is a man who can do it plus, Turkey is right \xe2\x80\x9cnext door.\xe2\x80\x9d Our troops are coming home!'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cThe President has been remarkable. I do not doubt that he will thrive in this new environment, and he will be a constant reminder of what populism is.\xe2\x80\x9d Thank you to Tammy Bruce and Steve Hilton. Presidential Harassment has been with me from the beginning!'
b'The most important way to stop gangs, drugs, human trafficking and massive crime is at our Southern Border. We need Border Security, and as EVERYONE knows, you can\xe2\x80\x99t have Border Security without a Wall. The Drones &; Technology are just bells and whistles. Safety for America!'
b'Mitch McConnell just told a group of people, and me, that he has been in the U.S. Senate for 32 years and the last two have been by far the best &; most productive of his career. Tax &; Regulation Cuts, VA Choice, Farm Bill, Criminal Justice Reform, Judgeships &; much more. Great!'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cIt should not be the job of America to replace regimes around the world. This is what President Trump recognized in Iraq, that it was the biggest foreign policy disaster of the last several decades, and he\xe2\x80\x99s right...The generals still don\xe2\x80\x99t get the mistake.\xe2\x80\x9d  @RandPaul'
b'Thanks @RandPaul  \xe2\x80\x9cI am very proud of the President. This is exactly what he promised, and I think the people agree with him. We\xe2\x80\x99ve been at war too long and in too many places...spent several trillion dollars on these wars everywhere. He\xe2\x80\x99s different...that\xe2\x80\x99s why he got elected.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'.....Bob Corker was responsible for giving us the horrible Iran Nuclear Deal, which I ended, yet he badmouths me for wanting to bring our young people safely back home. Bob wanted to run and asked for my endorsement. I said NO and the game was over. #MAGA I LOVE TENNESSEE!'
b'Senator Bob Corker just stated that, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m so priveledged to serve in the Senate for twelve years, and that\xe2\x80\x99s what I told the people of our state that\xe2\x80\x99s what I\xe2\x80\x99d do, serve for two terms.\xe2\x80\x9d But that is Not True - wanted to run but poll numbers TANKED when I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t endorse him.....'
b'We signed two pieces of major legislation this week, Criminal Justice Reform and the Farm Bill. These are two Big Deals, but all the Fake News Media wants to talk about is \xe2\x80\x9cthe mistake\xe2\x80\x9d of bringing our young people back home from the Never Ending Wars. It all began 19 years ago!'
b'Unthinkable devastation from the tsunami disaster in Indonesia. More than two hundred dead and nearly a thousand injured or unaccounted for. We are praying for recovery and healing. America is with you!'
b'I just had a long and productive call with President @RT_Erdogan of Turkey. We discussed ISIS, our mutual involvement in Syria, &; the slow &; highly coordinated pullout of U.S. troops from the area. After many years they are coming home. We also discussed heavily expanded Trade.'
b'I am pleased to announce that our very talented Deputy Secretary of Defense, Patrick Shanahan, will assume the title of Acting Secretary of Defense starting January 1, 2019. Patrick has a long list of accomplishments while serving as Deputy, &; previously Boeing. He will be great!'
b'The only way to stop drugs, gangs, human trafficking, criminal elements and much else from coming into our Country is with a Wall or Barrier. Drones and all of the rest are wonderful and lots of fun, but it is only a good old fashioned Wall that works!'
b'When President Obama ingloriously fired Jim Mattis, I gave him a second chance. Some thought I shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t, I thought I should. Interesting relationship-but I also gave all of the resources that he never really had. Allies are very important-but not when they take advantage of U.S.'
b'If anybody but your favorite President, Donald J. Trump, announced that, after decimating ISIS in Syria, we were going to bring our troops back home (happy &; healthy), that person would be the most popular hero in America. With me, hit hard instead by the Fake News Media. Crazy!'
b'Brett McGurk, who I do not know, was appointed by President Obama in 2015. Was supposed to leave in February but he just resigned prior to leaving. Grandstander? The Fake News is making such a big deal about this nothing event!'
b'I will not be going to Florida because of the Shutdown - Staying in the White House!  #MAGA'
b'Senate adjourns until December 27th.'
b'I won an election, said to be one of the greatest of all time, based on getting out of endless &; costly foreign wars &; also based on Strong Borders which will keep our Country safe. We fight for the borders of other countries, but we won\xe2\x80\x99t fight for the borders of our own!'
b'The crisis of illegal activity at our Southern Border is real and will not stop until we build a great Steel Barrier or Wall. Let work begin!'
b'Will be having lunch in White House residence with large group concerning Border Security.'
b'....going to be there for three months, and that was seven years ago - we never left. When I became President, ISIS was going wild. Now ISIS is largely defeated and other local countries, including Turkey, should be able to easily take care of whatever remains. We\xe2\x80\x99re coming home!'
b'I am in the White House, working hard. News reports concerning the Shutdown and Syria are mostly FAKE. We are negotiating with the Democrats on desperately needed Border Security (Gangs, Drugs, Human Trafficking &; more) but it could be a long stay. On Syria, we were originally...'
b'OUR GREAT COUNTRY MUST HAVE BORDER SECURITY! 
b'Wishing Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg a full and speedy recovery!'
b'Some of the many Bills that I am signing in the Oval Office right now. Cancelled my trip on Air Force One to Florida while we wait to see if the Democrats will help us to protect America\xe2\x80\x99s Southern Border! 
b'A design of our Steel Slat Barrier which is totally effective while at the same time beautiful! 
b'Today, it was my honor to sign into law H.R. 7213, the \xe2\x80\x9cCountering Weapons of Mass Destruction Act of 2018.\xe2\x80\x9d The Act redesignates the @DHSgov Domestic Nuclear Detection Office as the Countering Weapons of Mass Destruction Office. Read more: 
b'Today, it was my great honor to sign the #FirstStepAct - a monumental bi-partisan win for the American people! 
b'I\xe2\x80\x99ve done more damage to ISIS than all recent presidents....not even close!'
b'The Democrats now own the shutdown!'
b'General Anthony Tata, author, \xe2\x80\x9cDark Winter.\xe2\x80\x9d I think the President is making the exact right move in Syria. All the geniuses who are protesting the withdrawal of troops from Syria are the same geniuses who cooked the books on ISIS intelligence and gave rise to ISIS.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'There has never been a president who has been tougher (but fair) on China or Russia - Never, just look at the facts. The Fake News tries so hard to paint the opposite picture.'
b'Thank you @SteveDaines for being willing to go with the so-called nuclear option in order to win on DESPERATELY NEEDED Border Security! Have my total support.'
b'Mitch, use the Nuclear Option and get it done! Our Country is counting on you!'
b'Even President Ronald Reagan tried for 8 years to build a Border Wall, or Fence, and was unable to do so. Others also have tried. We will get it done, one way or the other!'
b'Shutdown today if Democrats do not vote for Border Security!'
b'House Republican Vote, 217-185.'
b'The Democrats, whose votes we need in the Senate, will probably vote against Border Security and the Wall even though they know it is DESPERATELY NEEDED. If the Dems vote no, there will be a shutdown that will last for a very long time. People don\xe2\x80\x99t want Open Borders and Crime!'
b'No matter what happens today in the Senate, Republican House Members should be very proud of themselves. They flew back to Washington from all parts of the World in order to vote for Border Security and the Wall. Not one Democrat voted yes, and we won big. I am very proud of you!'
b'.....on a Border is only effective in conjunction with a Wall. Properly designed and built Walls work, and the Democrats are lying when they say they don\xe2\x80\x99t. In Israel the Wall is 99.9% successful. Will not be any different on our Southern Border! Hundreds of $Billions saved!'
b'The Democrats are trying to belittle the concept of a Wall, calling it old fashioned. The fact is there is nothing else\xe2\x80\x99s that will work, and that has been true for thousands of years. It\xe2\x80\x99s like the wheel, there is nothing better. I know tech better than anyone, &; technology.....'
b'Senator Mitch McConnell should fight for the Wall and Border Security as hard as he fought for anything. He will need Democrat votes, but as shown in the House, good things happen. If enough Dems don\xe2\x80\x99t vote, it will be a Democrat Shutdown! House Republicans were great yesterday!'
b'Soon to be Speaker Nancy Pelosi said, last week live from the Oval Office, that the Republicans didn\xe2\x80\x99t have the votes for Border Security. Today the House Republicans voted and won, 217-185. Nancy does not have to apologize. All I want is GREAT BORDER SECURITY!'
b'Thank you to our GREAT Republican Members of Congress for your VOTE to fund Border Security and the Wall. The final numbers were 217-185 and many have said that the enthusiasm was greater than they have ever seen before. So proud of you all. Now on to the Senate!'
b'....equipment. General Mattis was a great help to me in getting allies and other countries to pay their share of military obligations. A new Secretary of Defense will be named shortly. I greatly thank Jim for his service!'
b'General Jim Mattis will be retiring, with distinction, at the end of February, after having served my Administration as Secretary of Defense for the past two years. During Jim\xe2\x80\x99s tenure, tremendous progress has been made, especially with respect to the purchase of new fighting....'
b'Democrats, it is time to come together and put the SAFETY of the AMERICAN PEOPLE before POLITICS. Border security must become a #1 priority! 
b'Farm Bill signing in 15 minutes! #Emmys #TBT 
b'So hard to believe that Lindsey Graham would be against saving soldier lives &; billions of $$$. Why are we fighting for our enemy, Syria, by staying &; killing ISIS for them, Russia, Iran &; other locals? Time to focus on our Country &; bring our youth back home where they belong!'
b'Congress just passed the Criminal Justice Reform Bill known as the #FirstStepAct. Congratulations! This is a great bi-partisan achievement for everybody. When both parties work together we can keep our Country safer. A wonderful thing for the U.S.A.!!'
b'When I begrudgingly signed the Omnibus Bill, I was promised the Wall and Border Security by leadership. Would be done by end of year (NOW). It didn\xe2\x80\x99t happen! We foolishly fight for Border Security for other countries - but not for our beloved U.S.A. Not good!'
b'With so much talk about the Wall, people are losing sight of the great job being done on our Southern Border by Border Patrol, ICE and our great Military. Remember the Caravans? Well, they didn\xe2\x80\x99t get through and none are forming or on their way. Border is tight. Fake News silent!'
b'The Democrats, who know Steel Slats (Wall) are necessary for Border Security, are putting politics over Country. What they are just beginning to realize is that I will not sign any of their legislation, including infrastructure, unless it has perfect Border Security. U.S.A. WINS!'
b'....Russia, Iran, Syria &; many others are not happy about the U.S. leaving, despite what the Fake News says, because now they will have to fight ISIS and others, who they hate, without us. I am building by far the most powerful military in the world. ISIS hits us they are doomed!'
b'Does the USA want to be the Policeman of the Middle East, getting NOTHING but spending precious lives and trillions of dollars protecting others who, in almost all cases, do not appreciate what we are doing? Do we want to be there forever? Time for others to finally fight.....'
b'Getting out of Syria was no surprise. I\xe2\x80\x99ve been campaigning on it for years, and six months ago, when I very publicly wanted to do it, I agreed to stay longer. Russia, Iran, Syria &; others are the local enemy of ISIS. We were doing there work. Time to come home &; rebuild. #MAGA'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m proud of the President today to hear that he is declaring victory in Syria.\xe2\x80\x9d Senator Rand Paul.  \xe2\x80\x9cI couldn\xe2\x80\x99t agree more with the presidents decision. By definition, this is the opposite of an Obama decision. Senator Mike Lee'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cTrump gets no credit for what he\xe2\x80\x99s done in the Middle East.\xe2\x80\x9d  @IngrahamAngle  So true, thank you Laura!'
b'Col. Jim Carafano on @IngrahamAngle \xe2\x80\x9cTrump has made the Middle East a better place. When Trump came into office, ISIS was running amuck in the Middle East. Over a million refugees poured into Western Europe - none of that is happening today. That\xe2\x80\x99s all due to Trump.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'After historic victories against ISIS, it\xe2\x80\x99s time to bring our great young people home! 
b'....In any event, it goes on and on &; the new AG, who is now being replaced by yet another AG (who openly campaigned on a GET TRUMP agenda), does little else but rant, rave &; politic against me. Will never be treated fairly by these people - a total double standard of \xe2\x80\x9cjustice.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'...sleazebag AG Eric Schneiderman, who has since resigned over horrific women abuse, when I wanted to close the Foundation so as not to be in conflict with politics. Shady Eric was head of New Yorkers for Clinton, and refused to even look at the corrupt Clinton Foundation......'
b'The Trump Foundation has done great work and given away lots of money, both mine and others, to great charities over the years - with me taking NO fees, rent, salaries etc. Now, as usual, I am getting slammed by Cuomo and the Dems in a long running civil lawsuit started by.....'
b'We have defeated ISIS in Syria, my only reason for being there during the Trump Presidency.'
b'Mexico is paying (indirectly) for the Wall through the new USMCA, the replacement for NAFTA! Far more money coming to the U.S. Because of the tremendous dangers at the Border, including large scale criminal and drug inflow, the United States Military will build the Wall!'
b'In our Country, so much money has been poured down the drain, for so many years, but when it comes to Border Security and the Military, the Democrats fight to the death. We won on the Military, which is being completely rebuilt. One way or the other, we will win on the Wall!'
b'....This will keep our communities safer, and provide hope and a second chance, to those who earn it. In addition to everything else, billions of dollars will be saved. I look forward to signing this into law!'
b'America is the greatest Country in the world and my job is to fight for ALL citizens, even those who have made mistakes. Congratulations to the Senate on the bi-partisan passing of a historic Criminal Justice Reform Bill....'
b'....It will be beautiful and, at the same time, give our Country the security that our citizens deserve. It will go up fast and save us BILLIONS of dollars a month once completed!'
b'The Democrats, are saying loud and clear that they do not want to build a Concrete Wall - but we are not building a Concrete Wall, we are building artistically designed steel slats, so that you can easily see through it....'
b'Congratulations to @MarthaMcSally on her appointment by Governor @DougDucey as the Great new Senator from Arizona - I have no doubt she will do a fantastic job!'

b'....WILL NEVER BE PROVEN AND ARE LIKELY FALSE.\xe2\x80\x9d  Thank you to Michael Isikoff, Yahoo, for honesty. What this means is that the FISA WARRANTS and the whole Russian Witch Hunt is a Fraud and a Hoax which should be ended immediately. Also, it was paid for by Crooked Hillary &; DNC!'
b'Russia Dossier reporter now doubts dopey Christopher Steele\xe2\x80\x99s claims! \xe2\x80\x9cWhen you get into the details of the Steele Dossier, the specific allegations, we have not seen the evidence to support them.

b'Illegal immigration costs the United States more than 200 Billion Dollars a year. How was this allowed to happen?'
b'Facebook, Twitter and Google are so biased toward the Dems it is ridiculous! Twitter, in fact, has made it much more difficult for people to join @realDonaldTrump. They have removed many names &; greatly slowed the level and speed of increase. They have acknowledged-done NOTHING!'
b'I hope the people over at the Fed will read today\xe2\x80\x99s Wall Street Journal Editorial before they make yet another mistake. Also, don\xe2\x80\x99t let the market become any more illiquid than it already is. Stop with the 50 B\xe2\x80\x99s. Feel the market, don\xe2\x80\x99t just go by meaningless numbers. Good luck!'
b'Good luck today in court to General Michael Flynn. Will be interesting to see what he has to say, despite tremendous pressure being put on him, about Russian Collusion in our great and, obviously, highly successful political campaign. There was no Collusion!'
b'Biggest outrage yet in the long, winding and highly conflicted Mueller Witch Hunt is the fact that 19,000 demanded Text messages between Peter Strzok and his FBI lover, Lisa Page, were purposely &; illegally deleted. Would have explained whole Hoax, which is now under protest!'
b'Today I am making good on my promise to defend our Farmers &; Ranchers from unjustified trade retaliation by foreign nations. I have authorized Secretary Perdue to implement the 2nd round of Market Facilitation Payments. Our economy is stronger than ever\xe2\x80\x93we stand with our Farmers!'
b'Anytime you hear a Democrat saying that you can have good Border Security without a Wall, write them off as just another politician following the party line. Time for us to save billions of dollars a year and have, at the same time, far greater safety and control!'
b'It is incredible that with a very strong dollar and virtually no inflation, the outside world blowing up around us, Paris is burning and China way down, the Fed is even considering yet another interest rate hike. Take the Victory!'
b'The DEDUCTIBLE which comes with ObamaCare is so high that it is practically not even useable! Hurts families badly. We have a chance, working with the Democrats, to deliver great HealthCare! A confirming Supreme Court Decision will lead to GREAT HealthCare results for Americans!'
b'....The Russian Witch Hunt Hoax, started as the \xe2\x80\x9cinsurance policy\xe2\x80\x9d long before I even got elected, is very bad for our Country. They are Entrapping people for misstatements, lies or unrelated things that took place many years ago. Nothing to do with Collusion. A Democrat Scam!'
b'....a persecution of the President.\xe2\x80\x9d  Daniel Henninger, The Wall Street Journal. Thank you, people are starting to see and understand what this Witch Hunt is all about. Jeff Sessions should be ashamed of himself for allowing this total HOAX to get started in the first place!'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cIt looks here as though General Flynn\xe2\x80\x99s defenses are incidental to something larger which is for the prosecution to figure out if it can find a path to Donald Trump without quite knowing what that crime might be. It stops looking like prosecution and more looking like......'
b'Required television watching is last weeks @marthamaccallum interview with the wonderful wife of Rod Blagojevich and the @trish_regan interview with a Jerome Corsi. If that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t tell you something about what has been going on in our Country, nothing will. Very sad!'
b'The Democrats policy of Child Seperation on the Border during the Obama Administration was far worse than the way we handle it now. Remember the 2014 picture of children in cages - the Obama years. However, if you don\xe2\x80\x99t separate, FAR more people will come. Smugglers use the kids!'
b'Judge Ken Starr, former Solicitor Generel &; Independent Counsel, just stated that, after two years, \xe2\x80\x9cthere is no evidence or proof of collusion\xe2\x80\x9d &; further that \xe2\x80\x9cthere is no evidence that there was a campaign financing violation involving the President.\xe2\x80\x9d Thank you Judge. @FoxNews'
b'At the request of many, I will be reviewing the case of a \xe2\x80\x9cU.S. Military hero,\xe2\x80\x9d Major Matt Golsteyn, who is charged with murder. He could face the death penalty from our own government after he admitted to killing a Terrorist bomb maker while overseas. @PeteHegseth @FoxNews'
b'Remember, Michael Cohen only became a \xe2\x80\x9cRat\xe2\x80\x9d after the FBI did something which was absolutely unthinkable &; unheard of until the Witch Hunt was illegally started. They BROKE INTO AN ATTORNEY\xe2\x80\x99S OFFICE! Why didn\xe2\x80\x99t they break into the DNC to get the Server, or Crooked\xe2\x80\x99s office?'
b'So where are all the missing Text messages between fired FBI agents Peter S and the lovely Lisa Page, his lover. Just reported that they have been erased and wiped clean. What an outrage as the totally compromised and conflicted Witch Hunt moves ever so slowly forward. Want them!'
b'A REAL scandal is the one sided coverage, hour by hour, of networks like NBC &; Democrat spin machines like Saturday Night Live. It is all nothing less than unfair news coverage and Dem commercials. Should be tested in courts, can\xe2\x80\x99t be legal? Only defame &; belittle! Collusion?'
b'Wow, 19,000 Texts between Lisa Page and her lover, Peter S of the FBI, in charge of the Russia Hoax, were just reported as being wiped clean and gone. Such a big story that will never be covered by the Fake News. Witch Hunt!'
b'The pathetic and dishonest Weekly Standard, run by failed prognosticator Bill Kristol (who, like many others, never had a clue), is flat broke and out of business. Too bad. May it rest in peace!'
b'Never in the history of our Country has the \xe2\x80\x9cpress\xe2\x80\x9d been more dishonest than it is today. Stories that should be good, are bad. Stories that should be bad, are horrible. Many stories, like with the REAL story on Russia, Clinton &; the DNC, seldom get reported. Too bad!'
b'.......The Trump Administration will be announcing the new Secretary of the Interior next week.'
b'Secretary of the Interior @RyanZinke will be leaving the Administration at the end of the year after having served for a period of almost two years. Ryan has accomplished much during his tenure and I want to thank him for his service to our Nation.......'
b'Wow, but not surprisingly, ObamaCare was just ruled UNCONSTITUTIONAL by a highly respected judge in Texas. Great news for America!'
b'As I predicted all along, Obamacare has been struck down as an UNCONSTITUTIONAL disaster! Now Congress must pass a STRONG law that provides GREAT healthcare and protects pre-existing conditions. Mitch and Nancy, get it done!'
b'For the record, there were MANY people who wanted to be the White House Chief of Staff. Mick M will do a GREAT job!'
b'....I look forward to working with him in this new capacity as we continue to MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! John will be staying until the end of the year. He is a GREAT PATRIOT and I want to personally thank him for his service!'
b'I am pleased to announce that Mick Mulvaney, Director of the Office of Management &; Budget, will be named Acting White House Chief of Staff, replacing General John Kelly, who has served our Country with distinction. Mick has done an outstanding job while in the Administration....'
b'Thank you to @tim_cook for agreeing to expand operations in the U.S. and thereby creating thousands of jobs! 
b'....Kim Jong Un sees it better than anyone and will fully take advantage of it for his people. We are doing just fine!'
b'Many people have asked how we are doing in our negotiations with North Korea - I always reply by saying we are in no hurry, there is wonderful potential for great economic success for that country....'
b'China just announced that their economy is growing much slower than anticipated because of our Trade War with them. They have just suspended U.S. Tariff Hikes. U.S. is doing very well. China wants to make a big and very comprehensive deal. It could happen, and rather soon!'
b'Let\xe2\x80\x99s not do a shutdown, Democrats - do what\xe2\x80\x99s right for the American People!

b'Just did an interview with @HARRISFAULKNER on @FoxNews, airing now (1pmE.) Enjoy!'
b'....She will probably be given a pass, despite their terrible ratings. Congratulations to @RichardGrenell, our great Ambassador to Germany, for having the courage to take this horrible issue on!'
b'If it was a Conservative that said what \xe2\x80\x9ccrazed\xe2\x80\x9d Mika Brzezinski stated on her show yesterday, using a certain horrible term, that person would be banned permanently from television....'
b'WITCH HUNT!'
b'They gave General Flynn a great deal because they were embarrassed by the way he was treated - the FBI said he didn\xe2\x80\x99t lie and they overrode the FBI. They want to scare everybody into making up stories that are not true by catching them in the smallest of misstatements. Sad!......'
b'....guilty even on a civil basis. Those charges were just agreed to by him in order to embarrass the president and get a much reduced prison sentence, which he did-including the fact that his family was temporarily let off the hook. As a lawyer, Michael has great liability to me!'
b'....stated that I did nothing wrong with respect to campaign finance laws, if they even apply, because this was not campaign finance. Cohen was guilty on many charges unrelated to me, but he plead to two campaign charges which were not criminal and of which he probably was not...'
b'I never directed Michael Cohen to break the law. He was a lawyer and he is supposed to know the law. It is called \xe2\x80\x9cadvice of counsel,\xe2\x80\x9d and a lawyer has great liability if a mistake is made. That is why they get paid. Despite that many campaign finance lawyers have strongly......'
b'I often stated, \xe2\x80\x9cOne way or the other, Mexico is going to pay for the Wall.\xe2\x80\x9d This has never changed. Our new deal with Mexico (and Canada), the USMCA, is so much better than the old, very costly &; anti-USA NAFTA deal, that just by the money we save, MEXICO IS PAYING FOR THE WALL!'
b'.@FLOTUS Melania will be interviewed by @SeanHannity tonight on @FoxNews at 9:00pmE!'
b'The Democrats and President Obama gave Iran 150 Billion Dollars and got nothing, but they can\xe2\x80\x99t give 5 Billion Dollars for National Security and a Wall?'
b'Another very bad terror attack in France. We are going to strengthen our borders even more. Chuck and Nancy must give us the votes to get additional Border Security!'
b'Thanks to Leader McConnell for agreeing to bring a Senate vote on Criminal Justice this week! These historic changes will make communities SAFER and SAVE tremendous taxpayers dollars. It brings much needed hope to many families during the Holiday Season.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t care what you think of the President...it cannot bleed over to the FBI...Comey is confirming there is bias in the FBI...\xe2\x80\x9d \n-Chris Swecker'
b'James Comey just totally exposed his partisan stance by urging his fellow Democrats to take back the White House in 2020. In other words, he is and has been a Democrat. Comey had no right heading the FBI at any time, but especially after his mind exploded!'
b'Fake News has it purposely wrong. Many, over ten, are vying for and wanting the White House Chief of Staff position. Why wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t someone want one of the truly great and meaningful jobs in Washington. Please report news correctly. Thank you!'
b'Very productive conversations going on with China! Watch for some important announcements!'
b'Great job by Michael Anton on @foxandfriends. A true National Security expert!'
b'....People do not yet realize how much of the Wall, including really effective renovation, has already been built. If the Democrats do not give us the votes to secure our Country, the Military will build the remaining sections of the Wall. They know how important it is!'
b'.....I look forward to my meeting with Chuck Schumer &; Nancy Pelosi. In 2006, Democrats voted for a Wall, and they were right to do so. Today, they no longer want Border Security. They will fight it at all cost, and Nancy must get votes for Speaker. But the Wall will get built...'
b'....however, for strictly political reasons and because they have been pulled so far left, do NOT want Border Security. They want Open Borders for anyone to come in. This brings large scale crime and disease. Our Southern Border is now Secure and will remain that way.......'
b'.....Ice, Border Patrol and our Military have done a FANTASTIC job of securing our Southern Border. A Great Wall would be, however, a far easier &; less expensive solution. We have already built large new sections &; fully renovated others, making them like new. The Democrats,.....'
b'Despite the large Caravans that WERE forming and heading to our Country, people have not been able to get through our newly built Walls, makeshift Walls &; Fences, or Border Patrol Officers &; Military. They are now staying in Mexico or going back to their original countries.......'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cFormer FBI Director James Comey under fire for his testimony acknowledging he knew that the Democrats paid for that phony Trump Dossier.\xe2\x80\x9d @LouDobbs  Details on Tuesday night.'
b'James Comey\xe2\x80\x99s behind closed doors testimony reveals that \xe2\x80\x9cthere was not evidence of Campaign Collusion\xe2\x80\x9d with Russia when he left the FBI. In other words, the Witch Hunt is illegal and should never have been started!'
b'....which it was not (but even if it was, it is only a CIVIL CASE, like Obama\xe2\x80\x99s - but it was done correctly by a lawyer and there would not even be a fine. Lawyer\xe2\x80\x99s liability if he made a mistake, not me). Cohen just trying to get his sentence reduced. WITCH HUNT!'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cDemocrats can\xe2\x80\x99t find a Smocking Gun tying the Trump campaign to Russia after James Comey\xe2\x80\x99s testimony. No Smocking Gun...No Collusion.\xe2\x80\x9d @FoxNews  That\xe2\x80\x99s because there was NO COLLUSION. So now the Dems go to a simple private transaction, wrongly call it a campaign contribution,...'
b'I am in the process of interviewing some really great people for the position of White House Chief of Staff. Fake News has been saying with certainty it was Nick Ayers, a spectacular person who will always be with our #MAGA agenda. I will be making a decision soon!'
b'The Trump Administration has accomplished more than any other U.S. Administration in its first two (not even) years of existence, &; we are having a great time doing it! All of this despite the Fake News Media, which has gone totally out of its mind-truly the Enemy of the People!'
b'Leakin\xe2\x80\x99 James Comey must have set a record for who lied the most to Congress in one day. His Friday testimony was so untruthful! This whole deal is a Rigged Fraud headed up by dishonest people who would do anything so that I could not become President. They are now exposed!'
b'On 245  occasions, former FBI Director James Comey told House investigators he didn\xe2\x80\x99t know, didn\xe2\x80\x99t recall, or couldn\xe2\x80\x99t remember things when asked. Opened investigations on 4 Americans (not 2) - didn\xe2\x80\x99t know who signed off and didn\xe2\x80\x99t know Christopher Steele. All lies!'
b'It was my honor to attend today\xe2\x80\x99s #ArmyNavyGame in Philadelphia. A GREAT game played all around by our HEROES. Congratulations @ArmyWP_Football on the win!

b'Watched Da Nang Dick Blumenthal on television spewing facts almost as accurate as his bravery in Vietnam (which he never saw). As the bullets whizzed by Da Nang Dicks head, as he was saving soldiers....'
b'Very sad day &; night in Paris. Maybe it\xe2\x80\x99s time to end the ridiculous and extremely expensive Paris Agreement and return money back to the people in the form of lower taxes? The U.S. was way ahead of the curve on that and the only major country where emissions went down last year!'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cThis is collusion illusion, there is no smoking gun here. At this late date, after all that we have gone through, after millions have been spent, we have no Russian Collusion. There is nothing impeachable here.\xe2\x80\x9d @GeraldoRivera  Time for the Witch Hunt to END!'
b'....I am thankful to both of these incredible men for their service to our Country! Date of transition to be determined.'
b'I am pleased to announce my nomination of four-star General Mark Milley, Chief of Staff of the United States Army \xe2\x80\x93 as the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, replacing General Joe Dunford, who will be retiring....'
b'AFTER TWO YEARS AND MILLIONS OF PAGES OF DOCUMENTS (and a cost of over $30,000,000), NO COLLUSION!'
b'The idea of a European Military didn\xe2\x80\x99t work out too well in W.W. I or 2. But the U.S. was there for you, and always will be. All we ask is that you pay your fair share of NATO. Germany is paying 1% while the U.S. pays 4.3% of a much larger GDP - to protect Europe. Fairness!'
b'The Paris Agreement isn\xe2\x80\x99t working out so well for Paris. Protests and riots all over France. People do not want to pay large sums of money, much to third world countries (that are questionably run), in order to maybe protect the environment. Chanting \xe2\x80\x9cWe Want Trump!\xe2\x80\x9d Love France.'
b'Totally clears the President. Thank you!'
b"It is being reported that Leakin' James Comey was told by Department of Justice attorneys not to answer the most important questions. Total bias and corruption at the highest levels of previous Administration. Force him to answer the questions under oath!"
b'Hopefully Mitch McConnell will ask for a VOTE on Criminal Justice Reform. It is extremely popular and has strong bipartisan support. It will also help a lot of people, save taxpayer dollars, and keep our communities safe. Go for it Mitch!'
b'Mike Pompeo is doing a great job, I am very proud of him. His predecessor, Rex Tillerson, didn\xe2\x80\x99t have the mental capacity needed. He was dumb as a rock and I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t get rid of him fast enough. He was lazy as hell. Now it is a whole new ballgame, great spirit at State!'
b'....and one of the most highly respected lawyers and legal minds in the Country, he will be a great addition to our team. I look forward to having him join our very successful Administration!'
b'I am pleased to announce that I will be nominating The Honorable William P. Barr for the position of Attorney General of the United States. As the former AG for George H.W. Bush....'
b'I am pleased to announce that Heather Nauert, Spokeswoman for the United States Department of State, will be nominated to serve as United Nations Ambassador. I want to congratulate Heather, and thank Ambassador Nikki Haley for her great service to our Country!'
b'We will be doing a major Counter Report to the Mueller Report. This should never again be allowed to happen to a future President of the United States!'
b'Today, we honor those who perished 77 years ago at Pearl Harbor, and we salute every veteran who served in World War II over the 4 years that followed that horrific attack. God Bless America! 
b'It has been incorrectly reported that Rudy Giuliani and others will not be doing a counter to the Mueller Report. That is Fake News. Already 87 pages done, but obviously cannot complete until we see the final Witch Hunt Report.'
b'China talks are going very well!'
b'...the lying and leaking by the people doing the Report, &; also Bruce Ohr (and his lovely wife Molly), Comey, Brennan, Clapper, &; all of the many fired people of the FBI, be listed in the Report? Will the corruption within the DNC &; Clinton Campaign be exposed?..And so much more!'

b'Robert Mueller and Leakin\xe2\x80\x99 Lyin\xe2\x80\x99 James Comey are Best Friends, just one of many Mueller Conflicts of Interest.

A total Witch Hunt...'
b'Arizona, together with our Military and Border Patrol, is bracing for a massive surge at a NON-WALLED area. WE WILL NOT LET THEM THROUGH. Big danger. Nancy and Chuck must approve Boarder Security and the Wall!'
b'FAKE NEWS - THE ENEMY OF THE PEOPLE!'
b'Trish_Regan:  \xe2\x80\x9cDid the FBI follow protocol to obtain the FISA warrant? I don\xe2\x80\x99t think so. The Dossier was opposition research funded by opponents. Don\xe2\x80\x99t use Government resources to take down political foes. Weaponizing Government for gain.\xe2\x80\x9d Is this really America? Witch Hunt!'
b'Jerome Corsi: \xe2\x80\x9dThis is not justice, this is not America. This is a political prosecution. The Special Prosecutor (Counsel), to get this plea deal, demanded I lie and violate the law. They\xe2\x80\x99re the criminals.\xe2\x80\x9d He is not alone. 17 Angry Dems. People forced to lie. Sad!  @Trish_Regan'
b'Statement from China: \xe2\x80\x9cThe teams of both sides are now having smooth communications and good cooperation with each other. We are full of confidence that an agreement can be reached within the next 90 days.\xe2\x80\x9d I agree!'
b'Does the Fake News Media ever mention the fact that Republicans, with the very important help of my campaign Rallies, WON THE UNITED STATES SENATE, 53 to 47? All I hear is that the Open Border Dems won the House. Senate alone approves judges &; others. Big Republican Win!'
b'My thoughts and prayers are with the @USMC crew members who were involved in a mid-air collision off the coast of Japan. Thank you to @USForcesJapan for their immediate response and rescue efforts. Whatever you need, we are here for you. @IIIMEF'
b'Without the phony Russia Witch Hunt, and with all that we have accomplished in the last almost two years (Tax &; Regulation Cuts, Judge\xe2\x80\x99s, Military, Vets, etc.) my approval rating would be at 75% rather than the 50% just reported by Rasmussen. It\xe2\x80\x99s called Presidential Harassment!'
b'Working hard, thank you! 
b'Doug Wead, a truly great presidential historian, had a wonderful take on a very beautiful moment in history, the funeral service today of President Bush. Doug was able to brilliantly cover some very important and interesting periods of time! @LouDobbs'
b'Hopefully OPEC will be keeping oil flows as is, not restricted. The World does not want to see, or need, higher oil prices!'
b'Looking forward to being with the Bush family. This is not a funeral, this is a day of celebration for a great man who has led a long and distinguished life. He will be missed!'

b'One of the very exciting things to come out of my meeting with President Xi of China is his promise to me to criminalize the sale of deadly Fentanyl coming into the United States. It will now be considered a \xe2\x80\x9ccontrolled substance.\xe2\x80\x9d This could be a game changer on what is.......'
b'Very strong signals being sent by China once they returned home from their long trip, including stops, from Argentina. Not to sound naive or anything, but I believe President Xi meant every word of what he said at our long and hopefully historic meeting. ALL subjects discussed!'

b'.....China does not want Tariffs!'
b'We are either going to have a REAL DEAL with China, or no deal at all - at which point we will be charging major Tariffs against Chinese product being shipped into the United States. Ultimately, I believe, we will be making a deal - either now or into the future....'
b'....in the world. I want clean air and clean water and have been making great strides in improving America\xe2\x80\x99s environment. But American taxpayers \xe2\x80\x93 and American workers \xe2\x80\x93 shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t pay to clean up others countries\xe2\x80\x99 pollution.'
b'I am glad that my friend @EmmanuelMacron and the protestors in Paris have agreed with the conclusion I reached two years ago. The Paris Agreement is fatally flawed because it raises the price of energy for responsible countries while whitewashing some of the worst polluters....'
b'Could somebody please explain to the Democrats (we need their votes) that our Country losses 250 Billion Dollars a year on illegal immigration, not including the terrible drug flow. Top Border Security, including a Wall, is $25 Billion. Pays for itself in two months. Get it done!'
b'.....But if a fair deal is able to be made with China, one that does all of the many things we know must be finally done, I will happily sign. Let the negotiations begin. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!'
b'....I am a Tariff Man. When people or countries come in to raid the great wealth of our Nation, I want them to pay for the privilege of doing so. It will always be the best way to max out our economic power. We are right now taking in $billions in Tariffs. MAKE AMERICA RICH AGAIN'
b'......on seeing whether or not a REAL deal with China is actually possible. If it is, we will get it done. China is supposed to start buying Agricultural product and more immediately. President Xi and I want this deal to happen, and it probably will. But if not remember,......'
b'The negotiations with China have already started. Unless extended, they will end 90 days from the date of our wonderful and very warm dinner with President Xi in Argentina. Bob Lighthizer will be working closely with Steve Mnuchin, Larry Kudlow, Wilbur Ross and Peter Navarro.....'

b'I am certain that, at some time in the future, President Xi and I, together with President Putin of Russia, will start talking about a meaningful halt to what has become a major and uncontrollable Arms Race. The U.S. spent 716 Billion Dollars this year. Crazy!'
b'President Xi and I have a very strong and personal relationship. He and I are the only two people that can bring about massive and very positive change, on trade and far beyond, between our two great Nations. A solution for North Korea is a great thing for China and ALL!'
